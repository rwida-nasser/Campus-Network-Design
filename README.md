# Campus-Network-Design
 This project I've made presents a comprehensive network design for the Faculty of Engineering, including both the main academic building and the workshop facilities. It covers topology planning, IP addressing, network device selection, VLANs, and security considerations to ensure efficient and scalable connectivity across the campus infrastructure.
